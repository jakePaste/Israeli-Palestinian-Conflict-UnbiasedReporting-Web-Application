The project's emphasis on neutrality in reporting means that it strives to present information in an unbiased and objective manner. The goal is to provide a comprehensive perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by analyzing and presenting data from the UN OCHA without favoring any particular side. This approach ensures that the information provided is fair and balanced, allowing users to form their own opinions based on the data presented.

Ethical principles of transparency and avoiding bias are core values of the project. Transparency means that the project provides clear documentation on the sources of data, methodologies used, and any limitations or assumptions made during the analysis. This allows users to understand the context and reliability of the information presented.

Avoiding bias means that the project takes great care to avoid any subjective or prejudiced viewpoints. It ensures that the analysis and reporting are based solely on the data and that personal opinions or beliefs are not influencing the presentation of information. By adhering to these ethical principles, the project aims to provide a trustworthy and reliable source of information for users to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2023.
